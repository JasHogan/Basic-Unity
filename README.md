Basic Unity Game Mechanics

Different Scripts.

PlayerMovement will move the player with W,A,S,D and double jum sucessfully with 'space'.

PlayerMovement 1_1 through 1_3 are different attempts to get player to move Left, right, up, and down according to the Main Camera, or game window. Idk if Im close with any of them lol.
